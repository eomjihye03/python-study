Ode to a Cold
My nose flows like a restless stream,
My cough resounds like a beating drum.
My voice, a wandering traveler,
Lost in a land of hoarse and numb.

The sunlight dances beyond my pane,
Yet I lie trapped in blankets deep.
The world goes on, so bright, so sane,
While I drift in fevered sleep.
